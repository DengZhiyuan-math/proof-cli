"""Agent sessions for prism-local.

A chat turn runs on one of several AI backends (backends.py): the Claude Code CLI,
the Codex CLI, or an OpenAI-compatible API such as DeepSeek. This module does the
part that is the same for all of them: it checks the request, states the turn's
file scope, snapshots the editable files before the turn, reports per-file diffs
afterwards and can undo the turn.
